Causal_after: Chunking added though the whole pipleline and cutted after hifigan.
	-Causal_change is with changepoint
	-Causawl_without is without changepoint
	Both contain an original file with the kaggle parameters

Causal_before: Chunking added and then removed before HifiGan
	- Same Folders as Causal_after with the logic.
